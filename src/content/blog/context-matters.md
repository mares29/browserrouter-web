title: "Context Matters More Than Defaults"

Every operating system asks the same question during setup: which browser do you want as your default? It's a reasonable question with an unreasonable assumption—that you only ever want to use one browser.

## The multi-browser reality

Most of us live in at least two browsers. Chrome for work, with its profiles and extensions tied to our professional identity. Safari for personal browsing, where privacy matters more than compatibility. Maybe Firefox for development. Arc for that project you're exploring.

The operating system sees none of this nuance. Click a link in Slack, and it opens in Safari—even though you've spent the last hour in Chrome, working in that exact context.

## Context is invisible

The problem isn't that defaults exist. The problem is that defaults ignore context.

When you're deep in a work session, context isn't just which app you're using—it's the mental state you've built up. The tabs you have open. The frame of mind you're in. Breaking that context to manually choose a browser (or worse, having the wrong browser chosen for you) creates friction that accumulates throughout the day.

## What if software paid attention?

The best software disappears. It observes your patterns and acts accordingly, without asking permission for every decision.

That's the principle behind BrowserRouter. Not "which browser do you prefer?" but "which browser are you already using?" The answer changes throughout your day, and the software should respect that.

Sometimes the most powerful feature is simply paying attention.
