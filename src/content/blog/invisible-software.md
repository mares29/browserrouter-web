There's a particular kind of software that I find most satisfying to use: software that solves a problem so well that you forget it exists.

## The attention economy of apps

Most software demands attention. Notifications. Badges. Onboarding flows. Feature announcements. The modern app wants to be seen, to justify its existence through engagement.

But engagement isn't value. Often, the most valuable software is the software you interact with least.

## Invisible by design

When I think about the tools I rely on most, they share a common trait: they work without my involvement. My password manager autofills credentials. My backup software runs in the background. My window manager responds to keyboard shortcuts I've built into muscle memory.

I don't "engage" with these tools. I don't check their dashboards or explore their features. They just work.

## The design principle

Building invisible software requires a specific mindset:

**Default to working.** Don't ask for configuration that you could infer. Don't require setup that you could automate.

**Stay quiet.** If something succeeded, the user doesn't need to know. If something failed, only speak up if there's action to take.

**Respect context.** The user is trying to do something else. Your software is a means to an end, not the end itself.

## The paradox of success

The better BrowserRouter works, the less people think about it. Links just open in the right place. That's the goal—to solve a problem so thoroughly that the problem feels like it never existed.

It's a strange metric for success: the best outcome is to be forgotten. But that's the nature of tools. They exist to enable, not to impress.
